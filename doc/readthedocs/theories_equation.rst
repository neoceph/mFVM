Theories and Equations
=======================

Navier Stokes Equation coupled with energy equation is solved to calculate the temperature distribution, solid fraction, melt pool etc for a given spot and scan laser. In addition, volume of fluid method is used to track the free surface of the melt pool. The governing equations are given below.

.. math::
      \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{u}) = 0
